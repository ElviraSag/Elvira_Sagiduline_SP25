What operations do the following functions perform: 


Film_in_stock returns a list of inventory IDs, that indicates specific films in a specific store location. p_film_count parameter can identify how many total copies are available. Uses another function inventory_in_stock.


Film_not_in_stock function returns a list of inventory_ids for a given film_id and store_id where the film is currently not in stock (i.e., all copies are rented out or unavailable).


 Inventory_in_stock function checks if specific inventory ID is currently rented.


Get_customer_balance function calculates the total balance owed by a customer up to a specific date. It considers rental charges, overdue penalties, and past payments.


Inventory_held_by_customer returns the customer_id of the customer who currently holds (has not yet returned) a particular inventory item.


rewards_report function is designed to generate a list of customers eligible for a rewards program based on their monthly purchasing behavior.


Last_day function calculates and returns the last day of the month for a given timestamp input (with time zone).




Why does ‘rewards_report’ function return 0 rows? Correct and recreate the function, so that it's able to return rows properly.
Reason is in dates. Line below subtract 3 months from the current date.
last_month_start := CURRENT_DATE - '3 month'::interval; 


And the query below compare current date minus 3 months to last date in table ‘payment’:
   tmpSQL := 'INSERT INTO tmpCustomer (customer_id)
       SELECT p.customer_id
       FROM payment AS p
       WHERE DATE(p.payment_date) BETWEEN '||quote_literal(last_month_start) ||' AND '|| quote_literal(last_month_end) || '
       GROUP BY customer_id
       HAVING SUM(p.amount) > '|| min_dollar_amount_purchased || '
                 AND COUNT(customer_id) > ' ||min_monthly_purchases ;


But after investigation, we see that the period doesn't overlap. Query below shows that last payment date was on 2017-06-01:
SELECT * FROM payment p ORDER BY p.payment_date desc;
  



Correction in line last_month_start := CURRENT_DATE - '3 month'::interval; to line  last_month_start := CURRENT_DATE - '8 years'::interval;

Is there any function that can potentially be removed from the dvd_rental codebase? If so, which one and why?
I would suggest removing inventory_in_stock function.This function checks whether an inventory item is in stock by querying the rental table. However, if this logic is already covered by the combination of film_in_stock and film_not_in_stock, and there’s no additional business logic around inventory status, it could be removed in favor of combining these checks in a more efficient manner.


* The ‘get_customer_balance’ function describes the business requirements for calculating the client balance. Unfortunately, not all of them are implemented in this function. Try to change function using the requirements from the comments.


A new variable v_replacement_cost is introduced to hold the total replacement cost of films that are overdue by more than rental_duration * 2 days. This is calculated using the CASE statement to check if the difference between rental.return_date and rental.rental_date exceeds 2 * rental_duration (converted to days). If it does, the replacement_cost of the film is added to the balance.

* How do ‘group_concat’ and ‘_group_concat’ functions work? (database creation script might help) Where are they used?
The functions group_concat and _group_concat work together to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single text value, separated by commas (or another separator if desired). _group_concat: This function combines two text values with a comma separator.
group_concat: This is an aggregate function that uses _group_concat to combine all values in a column into one text string, separated by commas (or any separator if specified).




* What does ‘last_updated’ function do? Where is it used?
This function is used in a trigger to automatically update the last_update column whenever a record is updated. This is a trigger function, which means it's designed to be executed automatically in response to certain events, like an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation on a table.




* What is tmpSQL variable for in ‘rewards_report’ function? Can this function be recreated without EXECUTE statement and dynamic SQL? Why?
The tmpSQL variable in the rewards_report function holds a list of all customers meeting the monthly purchase requirements. The tmpSQL variable is used for constructing and running SQL queries dynamically based on parameters (like min_monthly_purchases and min_dollar_amount_purchased), which can change depending on the function input. 
This function can be recreated without using the EXECUTE statement and dynamic SQL. In fact, using EXECUTE and dynamic SQL for such operations is generally not needed unless there is a specific need for flexibility in the query structure (such as user-defined table names, or highly variable conditions)
