I have investigated what restriction are implemented in the dvd_rental database using several methods, First checking permission for the role one by one: 
  

  

  





Secondary, using query:




SELECT grantee, privilege_type, table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');
  





SELECT rolname, rolcanlogin, rolsuper, rolcreaterole, rolcreatedb
FROM pg_roles;


  



From all above I have made the conclusion that all rights and permissions are provided to one role ‘postgres’.
